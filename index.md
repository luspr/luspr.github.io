I believe in reason, progress, and human ingenuity. Therefore, I am passionate about data analytics and artificial intelligence -- and how those technologies are changing our lives for the better. Well understood and with a sound business model, data science can provide a lot of value in virtually every field. 
Besides the obvious examples from tech, I am excited how machine learning and AI will lead to innovation and enhance productivity in manufacturing, finance, and healthcare. 

At Siemens, I am currently working on digitalization projects in a diverse set of applications, such as oil and gas or the maritime industry. Leveraging cloud infrastructure and the industrial internet of things, I employ data analytics and artificial intelligence to enhance productivity, optimize workflows, and do predictive maintenance.
